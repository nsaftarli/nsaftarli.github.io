    Hi, I'm Nariman. I'm a fourth year student, working towards a BSc in computer science at Ryerson University. I'm interested in computer vision and machine learning. I'm currently interning as a research assistant with the <a style="color:#dea1a1; text-decoration:none" class="intro-blurb" href="https://ryersonvisionlab.github.io">Ryerson Vision Lab</a>, where I'm supervised by <a style="color:#dea1a1; text-decoration: none" class="intro-blurb" href="http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~kosta">Dr. Kosta Derpanis</a>.

I created this website mostly to learn a little bit about front end development and design, so updates to this page are rare. The best way to contact me is by e-mail.
